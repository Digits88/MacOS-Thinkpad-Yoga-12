# MacOS on Thinkpad Yoga 12
Hackintosh MacOS Mojave on Thinkpad Yoga 12 with ACPI hotpatches

## Pre-Installation

### 1. Warning - Achtung - Attention : check you BIOS version !!!

There is a known bug in embeded controller, where **CPU fan stop triggering**. This has been fixed with Bios version 1.20.

*I've experimented this bug (with BIOS 1.03 JEET47WW), and the CPU rises up quickly to 99Â°C at full load (even with short load). This is extremly dangerous for the health and lifespan of your laptop.*

**So you should update BIOS to version 1.20 at minimum !**

BIOS Summary of Changes at https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/jeuj84ww.txt

<1.20>
- (New) Updated Fan table
- (Fix) Fixed an issue that Fan stops working even when temperature reaching trigger point.

...

<1.08>
- (New) Removed authentication of WLAN cards.


So if you want to be able to replace the Wifi card with a MacOS compatible card, Bios version 1.08 or above is mandatory.

--> Version 1.20 or later recommended.

Due to so many horror stories and laptop bricked by BIOS update done from within Windows, I highly recommand to update BIOS only from bootable media (CD or USB thumb). Here you can find ISO file to download: https://support.lenovo.com/fr/fr/downloads/ds102287
If you get error message "secure flash athentication failed" while updating the BIOS, you should disable first "rollback prevention " in BIOS settings.

**Note: my installation guide will be based on Bios version 1.20.**


### 2. BIOS settings

- Disable Computrace
- Disable Vtd / Vtx
- Enable CSM
- Enable USB3

### 3. Know your hardware

- CPU: Intel Core i-5 5200U
- GFX: Intel HD Graphics 5500
- Display 12.5" FHD IPS LCD (VendorID: 30e4 | ProductID: 437)
- Wifi Intel -> Should be replaced by a Broadcom compatible WLAN card
- 8GB Ram
- Realtek RTS5227 PCI Express Card Reader
- Synaptics Touch Digitizer V04 (USB Internal port)
- CON4B2E72 Integrated Camera (USB Internal port)

- 
- Onelink Dock port for extension module [Onelink Pro Dock](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd029981)

#### What will work:
CPU, Graphic Card, Power Management, Battery, Sleep, Camera, Screen (FHD), brightness, HiDPI, Keyboard, Trackpad and Trackpoint, Sound, USB ports, HDMI port, Onelink Pro Dock (USB2/USB3, DisplayPort, DVI, Ethernet).

#### What will not work:
- Touchscreen
- ST Sensor Hub: gyroscope, Accelerometer, rotation detection, luminosity detection..

#### What will partially work:
- Tablet digitzer (with stylus): recognized as a mouse with button
- SD Card reader: a driver is under development, but not yet stable enough

#### WIFI alternatives:
Default Intel Wifi M.2 card is replaced by a Broadcom BCM94352Z card.
Thinkpad Yoga 12 M.2 wifi port is E keyed, so it's compatible with both A+E and E keys cards. So you can either use in it:

- Dell DW1560 (BCM94352Z) which is M.2 **"A+E" keyed**.
- Lenovo BCM94352Z (**FRU 04X6020**) which is M.2 **"E" keyed**.

So if you find a good price opportunity on Lenovo's BCM94352Z card, you can go for it on Yoga 12 ;) *This is not the case for every laptops*

While waiting for the internal wifi replacement card to arrive, I've used a USB wifi key TP-Link TL-WN725N. Mine is TL-WN725N **V2** (and V3 does also work). It works pretty well, while it's limited to Wifi-N (one band) at 150Mbps and occupy one of the two USB port available on this laptop. Note: for V2 of this adapter TP-Link recommnends the specific V2 of its driver. The V2 driver is unstable as hell, use instead V3 driver even for a V2 adapter (it works pretty well).

### 2. Hotpaches

It consitsts of a combinaison of ACPI replacements done in Clover plist along with additional custom SDST files.

#### 1. USB power management, port limiting and fix instant wake-up

Adapted from this guide: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-usb-power-property-injection-for-sierra-and-later.222266/

##### 1. Fix Embedded Controller reference

In config.plist rename EC0 to EC, in order AppleBusPowerController will get a proper access to embedded controller:

```
<dict>
	<key>Comment</key>
	<string>change EC0 to EC</string>
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<false/>
	<key>Find</key>
	<data>RUMwXw==</data>
	<key>Replace</key>
	<data>RUNfXw==</data>
</dict>
```
##### 2. Inject port limits and kUSB power management

USB controller is 8086_9cb1 with following ports:

- HS01: Left port, external (USB2)
- HS02: Right port, external (USB2)
- HS03: Onelink Pro Dock (USB2)
- HS04: Bluetooth, internal (USB2)
- HS05: Synaptic Touch Digitizer, internal (USB2)
- HS06: Integrated camera, internal (USB2)
- HS07: Not used
- HS08: ISD-V4 (tablet), internal (USB2)
- HS09: Not used
- HS10: Not used
- HS11: Not used
- SSP1: Left port, external (USB3)
- SSP2: Right port, external (USB3)
- SSP3: Onelink Pro Dock (USB3)
- SSP4: Not used
- SSP5: Not used

A SSDT hotpatch is used to:

- to enable only those used HS01,HS02,HS03,HS04,HS05,HS06,HS08,SSP1,SSP2,SSP3 with appropriate port values (external/internal). *Note: if you don't plan to use OneLink Dock, you can also disable HS03 and SSP3*
- to inject proper value for AppleBusPowerController
```
"kUSBSleepPortCurrentLimit", 2100,
"kUSBSleepPowerSupply", 2600,
"kUSBWakePortCurrentLimit", 2100,
"kUSBWakePowerSupply", 3200,
```
- to inject proper AAPL values for \\_SB.PCI0.XHC
```
"AAPL,current-available", Buffer() { 0x34, 0x08, 0, 0 },
"AAPL,current-extra", Buffer() { 0x98, 0x08, 0, 0, },
"AAPL,current-extra-in-sleep", Buffer() { 0x40, 0x06, 0, 0, },
"AAPL,device-internal", 0x02,
"AAPL,max-port-current-in-sleep", Buffer() { 0x34, 0x08, 0, 0 },
```


##### 3. Fix Power Call
```
<dict>
	<key>Comment</key>
	<string>change Method(GPRW,2,N) to XPRW, pair with SSDT-GPRW.aml</string>
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<false/>
	<key>Find</key>
	<data>
	FEUIR1BSVwI=
	</data>
	<key>Replace</key>
	<data>
	FEUIWFBSVwI=
	</data>
</dict>
```
and compile [SSDT-GPRW.dsl](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Clover-Laptop-Config/blob/master/hotpatch/SSDT-GPRW.dsl) to SSDT-GPRW.aml with MaciASL and add it to /Clover/ACPI/Patched/

#### 2. Fix LED blinking after waking up from sleep

In config.plist, replace method "WAKH"
14 4E 41 57 41 4B 48 09

by method "WAKO"
14 4E 41 57 41 4B 4F 09

```
<dict>
      <key>Comment</key>
      <string>change Method(WAKH to WAKO</string>
      <key>Disabled</key>
      <false/>
      <key>Find</key>
      <data>
      FE5BV0FLSAk=
      </data>
      <key>Replace</key>
      <data>
      FE5BV0FLTwk=
      </data>
</dict>
```
Then add and call an additional SSDT-LED.aml file that create a new method WAKH which calls the LED ON status \\_SI._SST (0x00) on wake up

#### 3. Brightness Hotkeys

```
<dict>
	<key>Comment</key>
	<string>change Method(_Q14,0,S) to XQ14</string>
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<false/>
	<key>Find</key>
	<data>
	X1ExNA==
	</data>
	<key>Replace</key>
	<data>
	WFExNA==
	</data>
</dict>
<dict>
	<key>Comment</key>
	<string>change Method(_Q15,0,S) to XQ15</string>
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<false/>
	<key>Find</key>
	<data>
	X1ExNQ==
	</data>
	<key>Replace</key>
	<data>
	WFExNQ==
	</data>
</dict>
```


### 2. HiDPI

Reference guide: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/adding-using-hidpi-custom-resolutions.133254/

#### 1. Enable HiDPI

```
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool YES
sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver DisplayResolutionDisabled
```
#### 2. Generate a display override plist

I don't have eagle eyes anymore to read confortably at 1920x1080 pixels on a 12.5" screen... So I tried to use scaled resolutions, but vthen erything is blurry. That's why I've used HiDPI feature to get crisp and clear scaled resolutions.

My custom override folder is set for 1920x1080 native resolution + 1600x900 scaled HiDPI + 1366x768 scaled HiDPI.

You can either copy my custom override folder [DisplayVendorID-30e4](https://github.com/gartempe/MacOS-Thinkpad-Yoga-12/tree/master/HiDPI) (copy the whole "DisplayVendorID-30e4" folder) in /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/ or generate your own at https://comsysto.github.io/Display-Override-PropertyList-File-Parser-and-Generator-with-HiDPI-Support-For-Scaled-Resolutions/ (also read the doc at the bottom of the page).

If you want to generate your own resolutions override, the LCD panel references in Yoga 12 are :
- VendorID: 30e4
- ProductID: 437

#### 3. Use RDM to switch resolution

### 2. SMBIOS



### 2. CPU Low Frequency Mode

By default in Macbook Air 7.1 and 7.2 CPU lowest CPU frequency is 1300Mhz, while the i5-5200U can go lower to 800Mhz on idle or basic load. This means, as-is, your CPU will consume too much power (and so drain battery) when on low frequency.
To fix that, you can patch the frequency vectors.

> Notice: The LFM frequency in Mac-9F18E312C5C2BF0B.plist is set to 1300 MHz!
	This restriction can be lifted with help of freqVectorsEdit.sh from:
	https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/freqVectorsEdit.sh

-> to check: https://github.com/nguyenlc1993/mac-os-k501l/wiki/Postinstall-optimization

Actually, I included 2 dummy kexts in the installation pack namely AppleGraphicsPowerManagement_K501LX.kext and X86PlatformPlugin_K501LX.kext, which contain the modified power profiles. You just have to install these two kexts to get the effect, thus no need to modify the original kexts.

Update to 10.14.1

after update, when all set and done, restarted with a fatal osxaptio error.

Had to update my old OsxAptioFixDrv-64.efi to OsxAptioFix3Drv-64.efi.
