# MacOS on Thinkpad Yoga 12
Hackintosh MacOS Mojave on Thinkpad Yoga 12 with ACPI hotpatches

## Pre-Installation

### 1. Warning - Achtung - Attention : check you BIOS version !!!

There is a known bug in embeded controller, where **CPU fan stop triggering**. This has been fixed with Bios version 1.20.

*I've experimented this bug (with BIOS 1.03 JEET47WW), and the CPU rises up quickly to 99Â°C at full load (even with short load). This is extremly dangerous for the health and lifespan of your laptop.*

**So you should update BIOS to version 1.20 at minimum !**

BIOS Summary of Changes at https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/jeuj84ww.txt

<1.20>
- (New) Updated Fan table
- (Fix) Fixed an issue that Fan stops working even when temperature reaching trigger point.

...

<1.08>
- (New) Removed authentication of WLAN cards.


So if you want to be able to replace the Wifi card with a MacOS compatible card, Bios version 1.08 or above is mandatory.

--> Version 1.20 or later recommended.

Due to so many horror stories and laptop bricked by BIOS update done from within Windows, I highly recommand to update BIOS only from bootable media (CD or USB thumb). Here you can find ISO file to download: https://support.lenovo.com/fr/fr/downloads/ds102287
If you get error message "secure flash athentication failed" while updating the BIOS, you should disable first "rollback prevention " in BIOS settings.

**Note: my installation guide will be based on Bios version 1.20.**

## Installation

## Post-Installation

### 1. Tools needed

- Clover Installer
- Clover configurator
- MacIasl
- iasl

...

### 2. Hotpaches

It consitsts of a combinaison of ACPI replacements done in Clover plist along with additional custom SDST files.

#### 1. USB power management, port limiting and fix instant wake-up

#### 2. Fix LED blinking after waking up from sleep

In config.plist,replace method "WAKH"
14 4E 41 57 41 4B 48 09

by method "WAKO"
14 4E 41 57 41 4B 4F 09

```
dict>
      <key>Comment</key>
      <string>change Method(WAKH to WAKO</string>
      <key>Disabled</key>
      <false/>
      <key>Find</key>
      <data>
      FE5BV0FLSAk=
      </data>
      <key>Replace</key>
      <data>
      FE5BV0FLTwk=
      </data>
</dict>
```
Then add and call an additional SSDT-LED.aml file that create a new method WAKH which calls the LED ON status \\_SI._SST (0x00) on wake up

#### 3. Brightness Hotkeys

### 2. HiDPI

Reference guide: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/adding-using-hidpi-custom-resolutions.133254/

#### 1. Enable HiDPI

```
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool YES
sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver DisplayResolutionDisabled
```
#### 2. Generate a display override plist

You can either copy my custom override folder in /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/ or generate your own at https://comsysto.github.io/Display-Override-PropertyList-File-Parser-and-Generator-with-HiDPI-Support-For-Scaled-Resolutions/

LCD panel reference in Yoga 12 is :
- VendorID: 30e4
- ProductID: 437

#### 3. Use RDM to switch resolution

### 2. CPU Low Frequency Mode

By default in Macbook Air 7.1 and 7.2 CPU lowest CPU frequency is 1300Mhz, while the i5-5200U can go lower to 800Mhz on idle or basic load. This means, as-is, your CPU will consume too much power (and so drain battery) when on low frequency.
To fix that, you can patch the frequency vectors.

> Notice: The LFM frequency in Mac-9F18E312C5C2BF0B.plist is set to 1300 MHz!
	This restriction can be lifted with help of freqVectorsEdit.sh from:
